# DWD - Deutscher Wetterdienst

This is a quick library, I've wrote to recive the air temperature for a specific location in germany from the ftp server of the "DWD".

I use this to compare it with other temperature data in my analysis platform, cause I do some research on prediction of water temperature for an embedded application.
