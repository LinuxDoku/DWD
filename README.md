# DWD - Deutscher Wetterdienst

This is a quick and dirty library, I've wrote to receive the air temperature for a specific location in germany from the ftp server of the "DWD". This lib uses the public ftp, which can be accessed without registration.

I use this to compare it with other temperature data in my own data analysis platform, cause I do some research on prediction of water temperature for an embedded application.
